    <strong>Cindy is addicted to capybaras</strong></p><h2>
    <h3>
    <p>
    16 years old</p>
    <p>
    She has dedicated her life to capybara exploration</p>
    <p>
    Her family is worried.</p>
    <p>
    Sometimes she travels across the world to sit in capybara habitats and watch them eat.
    </p>
    <p>
    She spends so much time with them that some say she is beginning to resemble a capybara!
    </p>
    <p>
    *especially when they mate
